Microservices | Dapper | CQRS | RabbitMQ | Ocelot

In this repo i have created microservices using asp.net core 6 and used Dapper in customer microservice, CQRS ( Command and Query Responsibility Segregation ) in product microservice,
Used RabbitMQ for messaging sending and receiving  and at the end implemented API Gateway using Ocelot.
